# Browser
a Web Browser that I have been working on. The browser is going to Run off of TOR Relay Nodes. Currently It's in the BETA Stages which means it is currently running through the Open-Web.

Please report any bugs to me and allow me time to fix them. I am constantly busy working on new projects and working on real world things. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Feel free to ask me anything!
